# JKey
An OS X status bar application that will input the keystroke "j" when you click on the corresponding status bar item. The keystroke value is changable.

To change the keystroke value or quit the application, right click (or ctrl/⌘ + left click) and then select the desired menu item. Note: Right click only works with OS X Yosemite and later. Users running previous versions will need to access the right click context via ctrl/⌘ + left click.
